/*
 * inference_ddr.h — whole-run DDR bandwidth counters for generated
 *                   inference projects.
 *
 * Probes /sys/bus/event_source/devices/ for a DDR PMU exposed by the
 * Linux perf subsystem (e.g. xilinx_ddrc on Zynq UltraScale+) and opens
 * read/write event counters via perf_event_open(2).  Counters are
 * snapshotted around the timed measurement window; bandwidth is
 * reported by inference_ddr_dump_json() as a "DDR_JSON: {…}" line that
 * the host harness can parse alongside LAYERS_JSON.
 *
 * This module is opt-in via the same INFERENCE_PROFILING gate as the
 * per-layer profiler — when off, the API is omitted entirely.  When on
 * but no DDR PMU is available (no driver, wrong kernel, missing
 * permission), inference_ddr_init() prints a single warning to stderr
 * and returns non-zero; subsequent calls are silent no-ops, and
 * inference_ddr_dump_json() emits {"available":false,"reason":"…"} so
 * the host can record the diagnostic.
 *
 * Bare-metal target: stubbed; perf counters require Linux.
 *
 * Thread-safety: none.  start/stop pairs are strictly nested.
