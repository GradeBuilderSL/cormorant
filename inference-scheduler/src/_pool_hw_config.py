"""
PoolingKernel hardware-bound constants resolved from the platform JSON.

The PoolingKernel sizes its line buffer and unrolled per-position adders at
compile time, so a model whose pool window violates those bounds has no
fallback path.  The Python scheduler must reject such models *before*
codegen, and the bound values it checks against MUST match whatever the
actual C++ build was configured with — otherwise generated C code would
reference geometries the kernel can't service.

Source of truth: ``platforms/<AXI_PLATFORM>.json`` ``kernels.pool`` object,
the same file the C++ CMake build reads (see ``pool_load_constants()`` in
``kernels/pool/CMakeLists.txt``).  Keeping a single JSON file as the single
source means the Python validator and the C++ kernel build cannot drift
apart — no parsing of ``CMakeLists.txt`` defaults, no dependency on
``CMakeCache.txt`` having been generated.

JSON shape (only the fields this module reads)::

    {
      "kernels": {
        "pool": {
          "tile_c":            8,
          "max_kh":            7,
          "max_kw":            7,
          "max_line_buf_rows": 16,
          "max_line_buf_cols": 64,
          "ow_parallel":       2
        }
      }
    }

Platform selection (lower entries override higher ones):

1. **Default** — ``platforms/kv260.json`` in the repo (the only platform
   shipped today).
2. **``AXI_PLATFORM`` environment variable** — picks
   ``platforms/<value>.json``.  Mirrors the CMake cache var of the same
   name so a user who configured C++ with ``cmake -DAXI_PLATFORM=foo``
   can run the Python tools against the same platform with
   ``AXI_PLATFORM=foo .venv/bin/python ...``.

Missing / malformed fields raise ``PoolHwConfigError`` rather than
silently falling back to defaults — silent defaults defeat the whole
"single source of truth" property.

``kTileC`` and ``kOwParallel`` are read from the JSON but not exported
to the validator: any C runs (channel-tiled) and any out_w runs (residual
padding), so models cannot violate them.
